# Rust C Compiler
During my winter vacation, I decided to start following along with [Nora Sandler's Writing a C Compiler](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html). I've been interested in compilers for a long time, but besides making small esolangs and partial parsers for existing scripting languages, I've never sat down to build a compiler for a real language end-to-end.

I think Rust is a great language to do this in, and it's great practice for developing my intuition with the platform too!

This repository probably only works on Linux!
