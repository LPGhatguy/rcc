# Rust C Compiler
During my winter vacation, I decided to start following along with [Nora Sandler's *Writing a C Compiler*](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html).

I've been interested in compilers for a long time, but besides making small esolangs and partial parsers for existing scripting languages, I've never sat down to build a compiler for a real language end-to-end.

I think Rust is a great language to author a compiler in, and it's great practice for developing my intuition with the platform too!

Since this repository won't ever become useful on its own, it exists solely as reference code, whether for other people following along with the series or just for those curious about Rust or compilers.
